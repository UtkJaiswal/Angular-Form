[Node Version Manager (NVM) Install Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)



Make sure to close the terminal and reopen

### Install Node

Currently for this project we are using Node version v16.20.2

```bash
nvm install 16.20.2
```

Once you install a version of Node, the corresponding version of NPM is installed for you. So you donâ€™t need to install NPM separately.

To check the version of Node and npm

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

We can install multiple versions of Node to use a partcular version(say 16) we use 

```bash
nvm use 16
```
